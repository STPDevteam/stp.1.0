What is STP?
----------------

Standard Tokenization Protocol is an open-source standard defining how tokenized assets are issued and transferred while complying with all necessary regulations. Tokens built on top of the STP-Standard will use the protocol's on-chain Validator to verify compliance with any jurisdictional or issuer-specific requirements.

Standard Tokenization Protocol allows assets to be tokenized in a way that makes them fully compliant across jurisdictions and transferable across any blockchain platform. For more information, see https://stp.network
